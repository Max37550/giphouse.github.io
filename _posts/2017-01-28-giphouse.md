#### GiPHouse

GiPHouse is a virtual software company of the Radboud University Nijmegen, which has already been active for more than 25 years. GiPHouse is entirely run by students and is divided in two main parts, which run independently from each other in the spring and fall semester (each part is active for half a year).

GiPHouse wants to have a great management system to easily keep track of their different projects. This will allow the directors of GiPHouse to more easily access information on enrolled students. It will also be possible to manage teams and GitHub repositories from this system. 
Furthermore, they would like to improve the student booking system for GipHouse rooms by integrating it directly with their website.
